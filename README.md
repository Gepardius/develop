Programming with Python
This is a Python-program that uses training data to choose the
four ideal functions which are the best fit out of the fifty provided (C) *.

    i)  Afterwards, the program uses the test data provided (B) to determine
        for each and every x-y-pair of values whether or not they can be assigned to the
        four chosen ideal functions**; if so, the programs to executes the mapping
        and saves it together with the deviation at hand
    ii) All data is visualized logically
    iii) Where possible, suitable unit-test were compiled
